# Code Refractor

### Description
The goal of this project is to edit the code so it meets proper accessibiliy standards. The purpose is to understand proper formatting in html and css. This project helped understand why semantic elements are useful. I learned what a good code source should look like and how important readablity is. 

## The process
For this task i was asked to make the source code have semantic elements, have a logical structure, create alt attributes for all images and create a descriptive title.

### What i did
* Changed all div elements to be header, main, aside, footer and section
* Created descriptive alt tages for all images
* Spaced out each section for readablity
* Changed the title to relate to pages content
